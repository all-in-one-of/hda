# Houdini Digital Assets

Just a little place to keep HDAs I'd like to share with the world. I spend a lot of time recreating these sorts of things from scratch going from studio to studio so I may as well do it once on my own time and set them free.

I only have access to an Indie license right now so they're .hdalc, will re-build them next time I get a full license. Or if you'd like to do it for me, even better!

These are open source, available under the terms of the MIT license.
